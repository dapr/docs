- `connectionString` is the [EventHubs connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/authorize-access-shared-access-signature). Note that this is the EventHub itself and not the EventHubs namespace. Make sure to use the child EventHub shared access policy connection string.
- `consumerGroup` is the name of an [EventHubs Consumer Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#consumer-groups) to listen on.
- `storageAccountName` Is the name of the account of the Azure Storage account to persist checkpoints data on.
- `storageAccountKey`  Is the account key for the Azure Storage account to persist checkpoints data on.
- `storageContainerName` Is the name of the container in the Azure Storage account to persist checkpoints data on.
