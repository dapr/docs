# Deploy to hybrid Linux/Windows Kubernetes clusters

Dapr supports running on kubernetes clusters with windows nodes. You can run your Dapr microservices exclusively on Windows, exclusively on Linux, or a combination of both. This is helpful to users who may be doing a piecemeal migration of a legacy application into a Dapr Kubernetes cluster.   

Kubernetes uses a concept called node affinity so that you can denote whether you want your application to be launched on a Linux node or a Windows node. When deploying to a cluster which has both Windows and Linux nodes, you must provide affinity rules for your applications, otherwise the Kubernetes scheduler might launch your application on the wrong type of node.

## Pre-requisites

You will need a Kubernetes cluster with Windows nodes. Many Kubernetes providers support the automatic provisioning of Windows enabled Kubernetes clusters. 

1. Follow your preferred provider's instructions for setting up a cluster with Windows enabled

- [Setting up Windows on Azure AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/windows-container-cli)
- [Setting up Windows on AWS EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/windows-support.html)
- [Setting up Windows on Google Cloud GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster-windows)

2. Once you have set up the cluster, you should see that it has both Windows and Linux nodes available

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide

```
## Installing the Dapr Control Plane

If you are installing using the Dapr CLI or via a helm chart, simply follow the normal deployment procedures:
[Installing Dapr on a Kubernetes cluster](../../getting-started/environment-setup.md#installing-Dapr-on-a-kubernetes-cluster)

Affinity will be automatically set for kubernetes.io/os=linux. This will be sufficient for most users, as Kubernetes requires at least one Linux node pool.

> **Note:** Dapr control plane containers are built and tested for both windows and linux, however, we generally recommend using the linux control plane containers. They tend to be smaller and have a much larger user base.

If you understand the above, but want to deploy the Dapr control plane to Windows, you can do so by setting:

```
helm install dapr dapr/dapr --set global.daprControlPlaneOs=windows
```

## Installing Dapr applications

### Windows applications
In order to launch a Dapr application on Windows, you'll first need to create a Docker container with your application installed. For a step by step guide see [Get started: Prep Windows for containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment). Once you have a docker container with your application, create a deployment YAML file with node affinity set to kubernetes.io/os: windows.

1. Create a deployment YAML

Here is a sample deployment with nodeAffinity set to "windows". Modify as needed for your application.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: yourwinapp
  labels:
    app: applabel
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: applablel
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: applabel
      annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/id: "addapp"
        dapr.io/port: "6000"
        dapr.io/config: "appconfig"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: add
        image: yourreponsitory/your-windows-dapr-container:your-tag
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6000
        imagePullPolicy: Always
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
              - matchExpressions:
                - key: kubernetes.io/os
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - windows
```
This deployment yaml will be the same as any other dapr application, with an additional spec.template.spec.affinity section as shown above.

2. Deploy to your Kubernetes cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy_windows.yaml
```

### Linux applications
If you have already got a dapr application with runs on Linux, you'll still need to add affinity rules as above, but choose linux affinity instead.

1. Create a deployment YAML

Here is a sample deployment with nodeAffinity set to "linux". Modify as needed for your application.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: yourlinuxapp
  labels:
    app: yourlabel
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: yourlabel
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: yourlabel
      annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/id: "addapp"
        dapr.io/port: "6000"
        dapr.io/config: "appconfig"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: add
        image: yourreponsitory/your-application:your-tag
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6000
        imagePullPolicy: Always
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
              - matchExpressions:
                - key: kubernetes.io/os
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - linux
```
2. Deploy to your Kubernetes cluster
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy_linux.yaml
```

## Cleanup

```
kubectl delete -f deploy_linux.yaml
kubectl delete -f deploy_windows.yaml
helm uninstall dapr
```
