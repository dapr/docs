# Secret Store for Kubernetes

Kubernetes has a built-in state store which Dapr components can use to fetch secrets from.
No special configuration is needed to setup the Kubernetes state store.

Please refer to [this](../../concepts/secrets/README.md) document for information and examples on how to fetch secrets from Kubernetes using Dapr.
