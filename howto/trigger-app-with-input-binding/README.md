# Create an event-driven app using input bindings

Using bindings, your code can be triggered with incoming events from different resources which can be anything: a queue, messaging pipeline, cloud-service, filesystem etc.

This is ideal for event-driven processing, data pipelines or just generally reacting to events and doing further processing.

Dapr bindings allow you to:

* Receive events without including specific SDKs or libraries
* Replace bindings without changing your code
* Focus on business logic and not the event resource implementation

For more info on bindings, read [this](../../concepts/bindings/README.md) link.

For a complete sample showing bindings, visit this [link](https://github.com/dapr/samples/tree/master/5.bindings).

## 1. Create a binding

An input binding represents an event resource that Dapr uses to read events from and push to your application.

For the purpose of this HowTo, we'll use a Kafka binding. You can find a list of the different binding specs [here](../../reference/specs/bindings/README.md).

Create the following YAML file, named binding.yaml, and save this to the /components sub-folder in your application directory:

*Note: When running in Kubernetes, apply this file to your cluster using `kubectl apply -f binding.yaml`*

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: myEvent
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: bindings.kafka
  metadata:
  - name: topics
    value: topic1
  - name: brokers
    value: localhost:9092
  - name: consumerGroup
    value: group1
```

Here, you create a new binding component with the name of `myEvent`.

Inside the `metadata` section, configure the Kafka related properties such as the topics to listen on, the brokers and more.

## 2. Listen for incoming events

Now configure your application to receive incoming events. If using HTTP, you need to listen on a `POST` endpoint with the name of the binding as specified in `metadata.name` in the file.  In this example, this is `myEvent`.

*The following example shows how you would listen for the event in Node.js, but this is applicable to any programming language*

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
const app = express()
app.use(bodyParser.json())

const port = 3000

app.post('/myEvent', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body)
    res.status(200).send()
})

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Kafka consumer app listening on port ${port}!`))
```

### ACK-ing an event

In order to tell Dapr that you successfully processed an event in your application, return a `200 OK` response from your HTTP handler.

```javascript
res.status(200).send()
```

### Rejecting an event

In order to tell Dapr that the event wasn't processed correctly in your application and schedule it for redelivery, return any response different from `200 OK`. For example, a `500 Error`.

```javascript
res.status(500).send()
```

### Event delivery Guarantees
Event delivery guarantees are controlled by the binding implementation. Depending on the binding implementation, the event delivery can be exactly once or at least once.
