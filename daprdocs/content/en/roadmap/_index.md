### [Dapr Roadmap](https://aka.ms/dapr/roadmap)

Dapr encourages the community to help with prioritization. Please vote by adding a üëç on the GitHub issues for the feature capabilities you would most like to see Dapr support. This will help the Dapr maintainers understand which features will provide the most value.

Dapr welcomes contributions from the community. If there are features on the roadmap that you are interested in contributing to, please comment on the GitHub issue and include your solution proposal, if available.

<br />
The Dapr Roadmap progresses through the following four stages:

      <p class="card-text">GitHub issues (features) that have sparked interest from the Dapr community will be moved by maintainers into the Dapr Roadmap and by default added to the Backlog column. <br /><br />Please vote by adding a üëç to the features you would most like to see Dapr support as this will help influence priority.</p>
