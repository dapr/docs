---

Dapr implements both an HTTP and a gRPC API for local calls. gRPC is useful for low-latency, high performance scenarios and has language integration using the proto clients.

You can find a list of auto-generated clients [here](https://github.com/dapr/docs#sdks).

The Dapr runtime implements a [proto service](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/master/dapr/proto/runtime/v1/dapr.proto) that apps can communicate with via gRPC.

In addition to calling Dapr via gRPC, Dapr can communicate with an application via gRPC. To do that, the app needs to host a gRPC server and implements the [Dapr appcallback service](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/master/dapr/proto/runtime/v1/appcallback.proto)

## Configuring Dapr to communicate with an app via gRPC

### Self hosted

When running in self hosted mode, use the `--app-protocol` flag to tell Dapr to use gRPC to talk to the app:

```bash
dapr run --app-protocol grpc --app-port 5005 node app.js
```
This tells Dapr to communicate with your app via gRPC over port `5005`.


### Kubernetes

On Kubernetes, set the following annotations in your deployment YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
      annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/app-id: "myapp"
        dapr.io/app-protocol: "grpc"
        dapr.io/app-port: "5005"
...
```
