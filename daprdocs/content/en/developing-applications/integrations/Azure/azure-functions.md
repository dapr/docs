Dapr integrates with the [Azure Functions runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) via an extension that lets a function seamlessly interact with Dapr. 
- **Azure Functions** provides an event-driven programming model.
- **Dapr** provides cloud-native building blocks. 

The extension combines the two for serverless and event-driven apps.
