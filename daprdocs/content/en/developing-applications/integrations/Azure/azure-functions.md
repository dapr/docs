The Dapr Functions extension is currently in preview.
{{% /alert %}}


Dapr integrates with the [Azure Functions runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) via an extension that lets a function seamlessly interact with Dapr. Azure Functions provides an event-driven programming model and Dapr provides cloud-native building blocks. The extension combines the two for serverless and event-driven apps. 

Try out the [Dapr Functions extension](https://github.com/dapr/azure-functions-extension) samples.
