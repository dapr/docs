Azure API Management (APIM) is a way to create consistent and modern API gateways for back-end services, including as those built with Dapr. Dapr support can be enabled in self-hosted API Management gateways to allow them to forward requests to Dapr services, send messages to Dapr Pub/Sub topics, or trigger Dapr output bindings. For more information, read the guide on [API Management Dapr Integration policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-dapr-policies) and try out the [Dapr & Azure API Management Integration Demo](https://github.com/dapr/samples/tree/master/dapr-apim-integration).
