## Overview

Sometimes it is necessary to understand what's going on in the Dapr sidecar (daprd), which runs as a sidecar next to your application, especially when you diagnose your Dapr application and wonder if there's something wrong in Dapr itself. Additionally, you may be developing a new feature for Dapr on Kubernetes and want to debug your code.

his guide will cover how to use built-in Dapr debugging to debug the Dapr sidecar in your Kubernetes pods.

## Pre-requisites

- Refer to [this guide]({{< ref kubernetes-deploy.md >}}) to learn how to deploy Dapr to your Kubernetes cluster.
- Follow [this guide]({{< ref "debug-dapr-services.md">}}) to build the Dapr debugging binaries you will be deploying in the next step.


## Initialize Dapr in debug mode

If Dapr has already been installed in your Kubernetes cluster, uninstall it first:

```bash
dapr uninstall -k
```
We will use 'helm' to install Dapr debugging binaries. For more information refer to [Install with Helm]({{< ref "kubernetes-deploy.md#install-with-helm-advanced" >}}).

First configure a values file named `values.yml` with these options:

```yaml
global:
   registry: docker.io/<your docker.io id>
   tag: "dev-linux-amd64"
```

Then step into 'dapr' directory from your cloned [dapr/dapr repository](https://github.com/dapr/dapr) and execute the following command:

```bash
helm install dapr charts/dapr --namespace dapr-system --values values.yml --wait
```

To enable debug mode for daprd, you need to put an extra annotation `dapr.io/enable-debug` in your application's deployment file. Let's use [quickstarts/hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/master/hello-kubernetes) as an example. Modify 'deploy/node.yaml' like below:

```diff
diff --git a/hello-kubernetes/deploy/node.yaml b/hello-kubernetes/deploy/node.yaml
index 23185a6..6cdb0ae 100644
--- a/hello-kubernetes/deploy/node.yaml
+++ b/hello-kubernetes/deploy/node.yaml
@@ -33,6 +33,7 @@ spec:
         dapr.io/enabled: "true"
         dapr.io/app-id: "nodeapp"
         dapr.io/app-port: "3000"
+        dapr.io/enable-debug: "true"
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: node
```

The annotation `dapr.io/enable-debug` will hint Dapr injector to inject Dapr sidecar into the debug mode. You can also specify the debug port with annotation `dapr.io/debug-port`, otherwise the default port will be "40000".

Deploy the application with the following command. For the complete guide refer to the [Dapr Kubernetes Quickstart](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/master/hello-kubernetes):

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./deploy/node.yaml
```

Figure out the target application's pod name with the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                       READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
nodeapp-78866448f5-pqdtr   1/2     Running       0          14s
```

Then use kubectl's `port-forward` command to expose the internal debug port to the external IDE:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward nodeapp-78866448f5-pqdtr 40000:40000

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40000 -> 40000
Forwarding from [::1]:40000 -> 40000
```

All done. Now you can point to port 40000 and start a remote debug session to daprd from your favorite IDE.
