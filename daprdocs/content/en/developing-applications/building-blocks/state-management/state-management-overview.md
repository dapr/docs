## Introduction

Using state management, your application can store and query data as key/value pairs in the [supported state stores]({{< ref supported-state-stores.md >}}). This enables you to build stateful, long running applications that can save and retrieve their state, for example a shopping cart or a game's session state.

When using state management, your application can leverage features that would otherwise be complicated and error-prone to build yourself such as:

- Setting the choices on concurrency control and data consistency.
- Performing bulk update operations [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) including multiple transactional operations.
- Querying and filtering the key/value data.

Your application can use Dapr's state management API to save, read and query key/value pairs using a state store component, as shown in the diagram below. For example, by using HTTP POST you can save or query key/value pairs and by using HTTP GET you can read a specific key and have its value returned.

## Features
These are the features available as part of the state management API:

### Pluggable state stores
Dapr data stores are modeled as components, which can be swapped out without any changes to your service code. See [supported state stores]({{< ref supported-state-stores >}}) to see the list.

### Configurable state store behaviors
Dapr allows you to include additional metadata in a state operation request that describes how the request is expected to be handled. You can attach:
- Concurrency requirements
- Consistency requirements

By default, your application should assume a data store is **eventually consistent** and uses a **last-write-wins** concurrency pattern.

[Not all stores are created equal]({{< ref supported-state-stores.md >}}). To ensure portability of your application you can query the metadata capabilities of the store and make your code adaptive to different store capabilities.

### Concurrency
Dapr supports Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) using ETags. When a state value is requested, Dapr always attaches an ETag property to the returned state. When the user code tries to update or delete a state, itâ€™s expected to attach the ETag either through the request body for updates or the `If-Match` header for deletes. The write operation can succeed only when the provided ETag matches with the ETag in the state store.

Dapr chooses OCC because in many applications, data update conflicts are rare because clients are naturally partitioned by business contexts to operate on different data. However, if your application chooses to use ETags, a request may get rejected because of mismatched ETags. It's recommended that you use a retry policy in your code to compensate for such conflicts when using ETags.

If your application omits ETags in writing requests, Dapr skips ETag checks while handling the requests. This essentially enables the **last-write-wins** pattern, compared to the **first-write-wins** pattern with ETags.

{{% alert title="Note on ETags" color="primary" %}}
For stores that don't natively support ETags, it's expected that the corresponding Dapr state store implementation simulates ETags and follows the Dapr state management API specification when handling states. Because Dapr state store implementations are technically clients to the underlying data store, such simulation should be straightforward using the concurrency control mechanisms provided by the store.

Read the [API reference]({{< ref state_api.md >}}) to learn how to set concurrency options.

### Consistency
Dapr supports both **strong consistency** and **eventual consistency**, with eventual consistency as the default behavior.

When strong consistency is used, Dapr waits for all replicas (or designated quorums) to acknowledge before it acknowledges a write request. When eventual consistency is used, Dapr returns as soon as the write request is accepted by the underlying data store, even if this is a single replica.

Read the [API reference]({{< ref state_api.md >}}) to learn how to set consistency options.

### Setting content type

Some state store components might have different ways of maintaining and manipulating data, depending on its type.
Dapr supports passing content type in [State management API](#state-management-api) as part of request metadata.

Setting the content type is optional, and it is up to the component to make use of it. Dapr only provides the means of passing this information to the component.

With the HTTP API, you can set content type via URL query parameter `metadata.contentType`. For example, `http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/store?metadata.contentType=application/json`

With the gRPC API, you can set content type by adding key/value pair `"contentType" : <content type>` to the request metadata.

### Multiple operations

Dapr supports two types of multi-read or multi-write operations: **bulk** or **transactional**. Read the [API reference]({{< ref state_api.md >}}) to learn how use bulk and multi options.

#### Bulk read operations

You can group multiple read requests into a bulk (or batch) operation. In the bulk operation, Dapr submits the read requests as individual requests to the underlying data store, and returns them as a single result.

#### Transactional operations

You can group write, update and delete operations into a request, which are then handled as an atomic transaction. The request will succeed or fail as a transactional set of operations.

### State encryption
Dapr supports automatic client encryption of application state with support for key rotations. This is supported on all Dapr state stores. For more info, read the [How-To: Encrypt application state]({{< ref howto-encrypt-state.md >}}) topic.

### Shared state between applications
Different applications might have different needs when it comes to sharing state. For example, in one scenario you may want to encapsulate all state within a given application and have Dapr manage the access for you. In a different scenario, you may need to have two applications working on the same state be able to get and save the same keys. Dapr enable states to be isolated to an application, shared in a state store between applications or have multiple applications share state across different state stores. For more details read [How-To: Share state between applications]({{< ref howto-share-state.md >}}),

### Actor state
Transactional state stores can be used to store actor state. To specify which state store to be used for actors, specify value of property `actorStateStore` as `true` in the metadata section of the state store component. Actors state is stored with a specific scheme in transactional state stores, which allows for consistent querying. Only a single state store component can be used as the state store for all actors. Read the [API reference]({{< ref state_api.md >}}) to learn more about state stores for actors and the [actors API reference]({{< ref actors_api.md >}})

### Querying state 
There are two ways to query the state:
 * Using the [state management query API]({{< ref "#state-query-api" >}}) provided in Dapr runtime.
 * Querying state store [directly]({{< ref "#query-state-store-directly" >}}) with the store's native SDK.

#### Query API
The query API provides a way of querying the key/value data saved using state management in state stores regardless of underlying database or storage technology. It is an optional state management API. Using the state management query API you can filter, sort and paginate the key/value data. For more details read [How-To: Query state]({{< ref howto-state-query-api.md >}}).

#### Querying state store directly
Dapr saves and retrieves state values without any transformation. You can query and aggregate state directly from the [underlying state store]({{< ref query-state-store >}}).
For example, to get all state keys associated with an application ID "myApp" in Redis, use:

```bash
KEYS "myApp*"
```

{{% alert title="Note on direct queries" color="primary" %}}
Direct queries of the state store are not governed by Dapr concurrency control, since you are not calling through the Dapr runtime. What you see are snapshots of committed data which are acceptable for read-only queries across multiple actors, however writes should be done via the Dapr state management or actors APIs.

##### Querying actor state
If the data store supports SQL queries, you can query an actor's state using SQL queries. For example use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM StateTable WHERE Id='<app-id>||<actor-type>||<actor-id>||<key>'
```

You can also perform aggregate queries across actor instances, avoiding the common turn-based concurrency limitations of actor frameworks. For example, to calculate the average temperature of all thermometer actors, use:

```sql
SELECT AVG(value) FROM StateTable WHERE Id LIKE '<app-id>||<thermometer>||*||temperature'
```

### State Time-to-Live (TTL)
Dapr enables per state set request time-to-live (TTL). This means that applications can set time-to-live per state stored, and these states cannot be retrieved after expiration.

### State management API
The state management API can be found in the [state management API reference]({{< ref state_api.md >}}) which describes how to retrieve, save, delete and query state values by providing keys.
