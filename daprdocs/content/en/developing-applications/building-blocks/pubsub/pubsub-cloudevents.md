---

To enable message routing and provide additional context with each message, Dapr uses the [CloudEvents 1.0 specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/tree/v1.0) as its message format. Any message sent by an application to a topic using Dapr is automatically wrapped in a CloudEvents envelope, using the [`Content-Type` header value]({{< ref "pubsub-overview.md#content-types" >}}) for `datacontenttype` attribute.

Dapr uses CloudEvents to provide additional context to the event payload, enabling features like:

- Tracing
- Content-type for proper deserialization of event data
- Verification of sender application

## CloudEvents example

A publish operation to Dapr will result in a cloud event envelope containing the following fields:

- `id`
- `source`
- `specversion`
- `type`
- `traceparent`
- `traceid`
- `tracestate`
- `topic`
- `pubsubname`
- `time`
- `datacontenttype` (optional)

The following example demonstrates a cloud event generated by Dapr for a publish operation to the `orders` topic that includes a W3C `traceid` unique to the message, the `data` and the fields for the CloudEvent where the data content is serialized as JSON.

```json
{
  "topic": "orders",
  "pubsubname": "order_pub_sub",
  "traceid": "00-113ad9c4e42b27583ae98ba698d54255-e3743e35ff56f219-01",
  "tracestate": "",
  "data": {
    "orderId": 1
  },
  "id": "5929aaac-a5e2-4ca1-859c-edfe73f11565",
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "datacontenttype": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
  "source": "checkout",
  "type": "com.dapr.event.sent",
  "time": "2020-09-23T06:23:21Z",
  "traceparent": "00-113ad9c4e42b27583ae98ba698d54255-e3743e35ff56f219-01"
}
```

As another example of a v1.0 CloudEvent, the following shows data as XML content in a CloudEvent message serialized as JSON:

```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "xml.message",
    "source" : "https://example.com/message",
    "subject" : "Test XML Message",
    "id" : "id-1234-5678-9101",
    "time" : "2020-09-23T06:23:21Z",
    "datacontenttype" : "text/xml",
    "data" : "<note><to>User1</to><from>user2</from><message>hi</message></note>"
}
```

## Publish your own CloudEvent

If you want to use your own CloudEvent, make sure to specify the [`datacontenttype`]({{< ref "pubsub-overview.md#setting-message-content-types" >}}) as `application/cloudevents+json`.
If the CloudEvent that was authored by the app does not contain the [minimum required fields](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#required-attributes) in the CloudEvent specification, the message will be rejected. Dapr will add the following fields to the CloudEvent if they are missing:

- `time`
- `traceid`
- `traceparent`
- `tracestate`
- `topic`
- `pubsubname`
- `source`
- `type`
- `specversion`

Publish a CloudEvent to the `orders` topic:

```bash
dapr publish --publish-app-id orderprocessing --pubsub order-pub-sub --topic orders --data '{"specversion" : "1.0", "type" : "com.dapr.cloudevent.sent", "source" : "testcloudeventspubsub", "subject" : "Cloud Events Test", "id" : "someCloudEventId", "time" : "2021-08-02T09:00:00Z", "datacontenttype" : "application/cloudevents+json", "data" : {"orderId": "100"}}'
```

```

## Event deduplication

When using cloud events created by Dapr, the envelope contains an `id` field which can be used by the app to perform message deduplication. Dapr does not handle deduplication automatically. Dapr supports using message brokers that natively enable message deduplication.
