---

To enable message routing and provide additional context with each message, Dapr uses the [CloudEvents 1.0 specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/tree/v1.0) as its message format. Any message sent by an application to a topic using Dapr is automatically wrapped in a CloudEvents envelope, using the [`Content-Type` header value]({{< ref "pubsub-overview.md#content-types" >}}) for `datacontenttype` attribute.

Dapr uses CloudEvents to provide additional context to the event payload, enabling features like:

- Tracing
- Content-type for proper deserialization of event data
- Verification of sender application

You can choose any of three methods for publish a CloudEvent via pub/sub:

1. Send a pub/sub event, which is then wrapped by Dapr in a CloudEvent envelope.
1. Replace specific CloudEvents attributes provided by Dapr by overriding the standard CloudEvent properties.
1. Write your own CloudEvent envelope as part of the pub/sub event.

## Dapr-generated CloudEvents example

Sending a publish operation to Dapr automatically wraps it in a CloudEvent envelope containing the following fields:

- `id`
- `source`
- `specversion`
- `type`
- `traceparent`
- `traceid`
- `tracestate`
- `topic`
- `pubsubname`
- `time`
- `datacontenttype` (optional)

The following example demonstrates a CloudEvent generated by Dapr for a publish operation to the `orders` topic that includes:
- A W3C `traceid` unique to the message
- The `data` and the fields for the CloudEvent where the data content is serialized as JSON

```json
{
  "topic": "orders",
  "pubsubname": "order_pub_sub",
  "traceid": "00-113ad9c4e42b27583ae98ba698d54255-e3743e35ff56f219-01",
  "tracestate": "",
  "data": {
    "orderId": 1
  },
  "id": "5929aaac-a5e2-4ca1-859c-edfe73f11565",
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "datacontenttype": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
  "source": "checkout",
  "type": "com.dapr.event.sent",
  "time": "2020-09-23T06:23:21Z",
  "traceparent": "00-113ad9c4e42b27583ae98ba698d54255-e3743e35ff56f219-01"
}
```

As another example of a v1.0 CloudEvent, the following shows data as XML content in a CloudEvent message serialized as JSON:

```json
{
  "topic": "orders",
  "pubsubname": "order_pub_sub",
  "traceid": "00-113ad9c4e42b27583ae98ba698d54255-e3743e35ff56f219-01",
  "tracestate": "",
  "data" : "<note><to></to><from>user2</from><message>Order</message></note>",
  "id" : "id-1234-5678-9101",
  "specversion" : "1.0",
  "datacontenttype" : "text/xml",
  "subject" : "Test XML Message",
  "source" : "https://example.com/message",
  "type" : "xml.message",
   "time" : "2020-09-23T06:23:21Z"
}
```

## Replace Dapr generated CloudEvents values

Dapr automatically generates several CloudEvent properties. You can replace these generated CloudEvent properties by providing the following optional metadata key/value:

- `cloudevent.id`: overrides `id`
- `cloudevent.source`: overrides `source`
- `cloudevent.type`: overrides `type`
- `cloudevent.traceid`: overrides `traceid`
- `cloudevent.tracestate`: overrides `tracestate`
- `cloudevent.traceparent`: overrides `traceparent`

The ability to replace CloudEvents properties using these metadata properties applies to all pub/sub components.

### Example

For example, to replace the `source` and `id` values from [the CloudEvent example above]({{< ref "#cloudevents-example" >}}) in code:

{{< tabs "Python" ".NET" >}}
 <!-- Python -->
{{% codetab %}}

```python
with DaprClient() as client:
    order = {'orderId': i}
    # Publish an event/message using Dapr PubSub
    result = client.publish_event(
        pubsub_name='order_pub_sub',
        topic_name='orders',
        publish_metadata={'cloudevent.id': 'd99b228f-6c73-4e78-8c4d-3f80a043d317', 'cloudevent.source': 'payment'}
    )
```

{{% /codetab %}}

 <!-- .NET -->
{{% codetab %}}

```csharp
var order = new Order(i);
using var client = new DaprClientBuilder().Build();

// Override cloudevent metadata
var metadata = new Dictionary<string,string>() {
    { "cloudevent.source", "payment" },
    { "cloudevent.id", "d99b228f-6c73-4e78-8c4d-3f80a043d317" }
}

// Publish an event/message using Dapr PubSub
await client.PublishEventAsync("order_pub_sub", "orders", order, metadata);
Console.WriteLine("Published data: " + order);

await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
```

{{% /codetab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}


The JSON payload then reflects the new `source` and `id` values:


```json
{
  "topic": "orders",
  "pubsubname": "order_pub_sub",
  "traceid": "00-113ad9c4e42b27583ae98ba698d54255-e3743e35ff56f219-01",
  "tracestate": "",
  "data": {
    "orderId": 1
  },
  "id": "d99b228f-6c73-4e78-8c4d-3f80a043d317",
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "datacontenttype": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
  "source": "payment",
  "type": "com.dapr.event.sent",
  "time": "2020-09-23T06:23:21Z",
  "traceparent": "00-113ad9c4e42b27583ae98ba698d54255-e3743e35ff56f219-01"
}
```

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
While you can replace `traceid`/`traceparent` and `tracestate`, doing this may interfere with tracing events and report inconsistent results in tracing tools. It's recommended to use Open Telmentry for distributed traces. [Learn more about distributed tracing.]({{< ref tracing-overview.md >}})  

{{% /alert %}}


## Publish your own CloudEvent

If you want to use your own CloudEvent, make sure to specify the [`datacontenttype`]({{< ref "pubsub-overview.md#setting-message-content-types" >}}) as `application/cloudevents+json`.

If the CloudEvent that was authored by the app does not contain the [minimum required fields](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#required-attributes) in the CloudEvent specification, the message is rejected. Dapr adds the following fields to the CloudEvent if they are missing:

- `time`
- `traceid`
- `traceparent`
- `tracestate`
- `topic`
- `pubsubname`
- `source`
- `type`
- `specversion`

You can add additional fields to a custom CloudEvent that are not part of the official CloudEvent specification. Dapr will pass these fields as-is.

### Example

{{< tabs "Dapr CLI" "HTTP API (Bash)" "HTTP API (PowerShell)">}}

{{% codetab %}}

Publish a CloudEvent to the `orders` topic:

```bash
dapr publish --publish-app-id orderprocessing --pubsub order-pub-sub --topic orders --data '{\"orderId\": \"100\"}'
```

{{% /codetab %}}

{{% codetab %}}

Publish a CloudEvent to the `orders` topic:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3601/v1.0/publish/order-pub-sub/orders -H "Content-Type: application/cloudevents+json" -d '{"specversion" : "1.0", "type" : "com.dapr.cloudevent.sent", "source" : "testcloudeventspubsub", "subject" : "Cloud Events Test", "id" : "someCloudEventId", "time" : "2021-08-02T09:00:00Z", "datacontenttype" : "application/cloudevents+json", "data" : {"orderId": "100"}}'
```

{{% /codetab %}}

{{% codetab %}}

Publish a CloudEvent to the `orders` topic:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType 'application/cloudevents+json' -Body '{"specversion" : "1.0", "type" : "com.dapr.cloudevent.sent", "source" : "testcloudeventspubsub", "subject" : "Cloud Events Test", "id" : "someCloudEventId", "time" : "2021-08-02T09:00:00Z", "datacontenttype" : "application/cloudevents+json", "data" : {"orderId": "100"}}' -Uri 'http://localhost:3601/v1.0/publish/order-pub-sub/orders'
```

{{% /codetab %}}

## Event deduplication

When using cloud events created by Dapr, the envelope contains an `id` field which can be used by the app to perform message deduplication. Dapr does not handle deduplication automatically. Dapr supports using message brokers that natively enable message deduplication.
