Now that you've [authored the workflow and its activities in your application]({{< ref howto-author-workflow.md >}}), you can start, terminate, and get information about the workflow using HTTP API calls. For more information, read the [workflow API reference]({{< ref workflow_api.md >}}).

Manage your workflow within your code. In the `OrderProcessingWorkflow` example from the [Author a workflow]({{< ref "howto-author-workflow.md#write-the-workflow" >}}) guide, the workflow is registered in the code. You can now start, terminate, and get information about a running workflow:

```csharp
string orderId = "exampleOrderId";
string workflowComponent = "dapr";
string workflowName = "OrderProcessingWorkflow";
OrderPayload input = new OrderPayload("Paperclips", 99.95);
Dictionary<string, string> workflowOptions; // This is an optional parameter
CancellationToken cts = CancellationToken.None;

// Start the workflow. This returns back a "WorkflowReference" which contains the instanceID for the particular workflow instance.
WorkflowReference startResponse = await daprClient.StartWorkflowAsync(orderId, workflowComponent, workflowName, input, workflowOptions, cts);

// Get information on the workflow. This response will contain information such as the status of the workflow, when it started, and more!
GetWorkflowResponse getResponse = await daprClient.GetWorkflowAsync(orderId, workflowComponent, workflowName);

// Terminate the workflow
await daprClient.TerminateWorkflowAsync(instanceId, workflowComponent);
```

Manage your workflow using HTTP calls. The example below plugs in the properties from the [Author a workflow example]({{< ref "howto-author-workflow.md#write-the-workflow" >}}) with a random instance ID number.

### Start workflow

To start your workflow with an ID `12345678`, run:

```bash
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-alpha1/workflows/dapr/OrderProcessingWorkflow/12345678/start
```

### Terminate workflow

To terminate your workflow with an ID `12345678`, run:

```bash
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-alpha1/workflows/dapr/12345678/terminate
```

### Pause or resume a workflow

To plan for down-time, wait for inputs, and more, you can pause and then resume a workflow. To stop a workflow with an ID `12345678` until triggered to resume, run:

```bash
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-alpha1/workflows/dapr/OrderProcessingWorkflow/12345678/pause
```

To resume a workflow with an ID `12345678`, run:

```bash
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-alpha1/workflows/dapr/OrderProcessingWorkflow/12345678/resume
```


### Purge a workflow 

To remove actor state from your state store and avoid overloading your state stores, run:

```bash
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-alpha1/workflows/dapr/OrderProcessingWorkflow/purge
```

### Get information about a workflow

To fetch workflow information (outputs and inputs) with an ID `12345678`, run:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3500/v1.0-alpha1/workflows/dapr/OrderProcessingWorkflow/12345678
```

Learn more about these HTTP calls in the [workflow API reference guide]({{< ref workflow_api.md >}}).
