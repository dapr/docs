For http calls made to Dapr runtime, when an error is encountered, an error json is returned in http response body. The json contains an error code and an descriptive error message, e.g.
```
{
    "errorCode": "ERR_STATE_GET",
    "message": "Requested state key does not exist in state store."
}
```

Following table lists the error codes returned by Dapr runtime:
