{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Dapr Workflow is currently in beta. [See known limitations for {{% dapr-latest-version cli="true" %}}]({{< ref "workflow-overview.md#limitations" >}}).
{{% /alert %}}

Dapr provides users with the ability to interact with workflows and comes with a built-in `dapr` component.

## Start workflow request

Start a workflow instance with the given name and optionally, an instance ID.

```
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-beta1/workflows/<workflowComponentName>/<workflowName>/start[?instanceID=<instanceID>]
```

Note that workflow instance IDs can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes.

### URL parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`workflowComponentName` | Use `dapr` for Dapr Workflows
`workflowName` | Identify the workflow type
`instanceID` | (Optional) Unique value created for each run of a specific workflow

### Request content

Any request content will be passed to the workflow as input. The Dapr API passes the content as-is without attempting to interpret it.

### HTTP response codes

Code | Description
---- | -----------
`202`  | Accepted
`400`  | Request was malformed
`500`  | Request formatted correctly, error in dapr code or underlying component

### Response content

The API call will provide a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "instanceID": "12345678"
}
```

## Terminate workflow request

Terminate a running workflow instance with the given name and instance ID.

```
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-beta1/workflows/<workflowComponentName>/<instanceId>/terminate[?non_recursive=false]
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
 Terminating a workflow will terminate all of the child workflows created by the workflow instance. This can be disabled by setting the query parameter `non_recursive` to `true`. 
 
 Terminating a workflow will have no effect on any in-flight activity executions that were started by the terminated instance. 

{{% /alert %}}

### URL parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`workflowComponentName` | Use `dapr` for Dapr Workflows
`instanceId` | Unique value created for each run of a specific workflow
`non_recursive` | (Optional) Boolean to determine if Dapr should not recursively terminate child workflows created by the workflow instance, default value is false.

### HTTP response codes

Code | Description
---- | -----------
`202`  | Accepted
`400`  | Request was malformed
`500`  | Request formatted correctly, error in dapr code or underlying component

### Response content

This API does not return any content.

## Raise Event request

For workflow components that support subscribing to external events, such as the Dapr Workflow engine, you can use the following "raise event" API to deliver a named event to a specific workflow instance.

```
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-beta1/workflows/<workflowComponentName>/<instanceID>/raiseEvent/<eventName>
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
 The exact mechanism for subscribing to an event depends on the workflow component that you're using. Dapr Workflow has one way of subscribing to external events but other workflow components might have different ways.

### URL parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`workflowComponentName` | Use `dapr` for Dapr Workflows

`400`  | Request was malformed
`500`  | Error in Dapr code or underlying component

### Response content

## Resume workflow request

Resume a paused workflow instance.

```
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-beta1/workflows/<workflowComponentName>/<instanceId>/resume
```

### URL parameters

Purge the workflow state from your state store with the workflow's instance ID.

```
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0-beta1/workflows/<workflowComponentName>/<instanceId>/purge[?non_recursive=false]
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
 Purging a workflow will purge all of the child workflows created by the workflow instance. This can be disabled by setting the query parameter `non_recursive` to `true`.

### URL parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`workflowComponentName` | Use `dapr` for Dapr Workflows
`instanceId` | Unique value created for each run of a specific workflow

## Get workflow request

Get information about a given workflow instance.

```
GET http://localhost:3500/v1.0-beta1/workflows/<workflowComponentName>/<instanceId>
```

### URL parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`workflowComponentName` | Use `dapr` for Dapr Workflows
`instanceId` | Unique value created for each run of a specific workflow

### HTTP response codes

Code | Description
---- | -----------
`200`  | OK
`400`  | Request was malformed
`500`  | Request formatted correctly, error in dapr code or underlying component

### Response content

The API call will provide a JSON response similar to this:

```json

    "property1": "value1",
    "property2": "value2",
  },
  "runtimeStatus": "RUNNING",
 }
```

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`runtimeStatus` | The status of the workflow instance. Values include: `RUNNING`, `TERMINATED`, `PAUSED`  

## Component format

A Dapr `workflow.yaml` component file has the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: <NAME>
spec:
  type: workflow.<TYPE>
  version: v1.0-alpha1
  metadata:
  - name: <NAME>
    value: <VALUE>
 ```

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `metadata.name` | The name of the workflow component. |
| `spec/metadata` | Additional metadata parameters specified by workflow component |

However, Dapr comes with a built-in `dapr` workflow component that is built on Dapr Actors. No component file is required to use the built-in Dapr workflow component.
