## Configuration format

Multicast DNS (mDNS) is configured automatically in [self-hosted mode]({{< ref self-hosted >}}) by Dapr. There is no configuration needed to use mDNS as your name resolution provider.

## Behaviour

The component resolves target apps by using the host system's mDNS service. You can learn more about mDNS [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).

### Troubleshooting

On some enterprise-managed systems, mDNS may be disabled on macOS if a network filter/proxy is configured. Check with your IT department if mDNS is disabled and you are unable to use service invocation locally.

## Spec configuration fields

Not applicable, as mDNS is configured by Dapr when running in self-hosted mode.
