## Component format

To setup Zeebe command binding create a component of type `bindings.zeebe.command`. See [this guide]({{< ref "howto-bindings.md#1-create-a-binding" >}}) on how to create and apply a binding configuration.

See [this](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/product-manuals/zeebe/zeebe-overview/) for Zeebe documentation.

## Binding support

This component supports **output binding** with the following operations:

- `topology`
- `deploy-workflow`
- `create-instance`
- `cancel-instance`
- `set-variables`
- `resolve-incident`
- `publish-message`
- `activate-jobs`
- `complete-job`
- `fail-job`
- `update-job-retries`
- `throw-error`

### Output binding

Zeebe uses gRPC under the hood for the Zeebe client we use in this binding. Please consult the gRPC API reference for more information: 
https://stage.docs.zeebe.io/reference/grpc.html  

#### topology

The `topology` operation obtains the current topology of the cluster the gateway is part of.

To perform a `topology` operation, invoke the Zeebe command binding with a `POST` method and the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "operation": "topology"
}
```

##### Response

The binding returns a JSON with the following response:

```json
{
  "brokers": [
    {
      "nodeId": null,
      "host": "172.18.0.5",
      "port": 26501,
      "partitions": [
        {
          "partitionId": 1,
          "role": null,
          "health": null
        }
      ],
      "version": "0.26.0"
    }
  ],
  "clusterSize": 1,
  "partitionsCount": 1,
  "replicationFactor": 1,
  "gatewayVersion": "0.26.0"
}
```

The response values are:

    - `nodeId` - unique (within a cluster) node ID for the broker
    - `host` - hostname of the broker
    - `port` - port for the broker
    - `port` - port for the broker
    - `partitions` - list of partitions managed or replicated on this broker
        - `partitionId` - the unique ID of this partition
        - `role` - the role of the broker for this partition
        - `health` - the health of this partition
  - `version` - broker version
- `clusterSize` - how many nodes are in the cluster
- `partitionsCount` - how many partitions are spread across the cluster
- `replicationFactor` - configured replication factor for this cluster
- `gatewayVersion` - gateway version

#### deploy-workflow

The `deploy-workflow` operation deploys a single workflow to Zeebe.

To perform a `deploy-workflow` operation, invoke the Zeebe command binding with a `POST` method and the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "data": "YOUR_FILE_CONTENT",
  "metadata": {
    "fileName": "products-process.bpmn",
    "fileType": "bpmn"
  },
  "operation": "deploy-workflow"
}
```

The metadata parameters are:

- `fileName` - the name of the workflow file
- `fileType` - (optional) the type of the file 'bpmn' or 'file'. If no type was given, the default will be recognized based on the file extension 
  'bpmn' for file extension .bpmn, for all other files it will be set to 'file'

##### Response

The binding returns a JSON with the following response:

```json
{
  "key": 2251799813687320,
  "workflows": [
    {
      "bpmnProcessId": "products-process",
      "version": 3,
      "workflowKey": 2251799813685895,
      "resourceName": "products-process.bpmn"
    }
  ]
}
```

The response values are:

- `key` - the unique key identifying the deployment
- `workflows` - a list of deployed workflows
    - `bpmnProcessId` - the bpmn process ID, as parsed during deployment; together with the version forms a unique identifier for a specific 
      workflow definition
    - `version` - the assigned process version
    - `workflowKey` - the assigned key, which acts as a unique identifier for this workflow
    - `resourceName` - the resource name from which this workflow was parsed

#### create-instance

The `create-instance` operation creates and starts an instance of the specified workflow. The workflow definition to use to create the instance can be 
specified either using its unique key (as returned by the `deploy-workflow` operation), or using the BPMN process ID and a version.

Note that only workflows with none start events can be started through this command.

##### By BPMN process ID

To perform a `create-instance` operation, invoke the Zeebe command binding with a `POST` method and the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "bpmnProcessId": "products-process",
    "variables": {
      "productId": "some-product-id",
      "productName": "some-product-name",
      "productKey": "some-product-key"
    }

- `version` - (optional, default: latest version) the version of the process to instantiate
- `variables` - (optional) JSON document that will instantiate the variables for the root variable scope of the
  workflow instance; it must be a JSON object, as variables will be mapped in a
  key-value fashion. e.g. { "a": 1, "b": 2 } will create two variables, named "a" and
  "b" respectively, with their associated values. [{ "a": 1, "b": 2 }] would not be a
  valid argument, as the root of the JSON document is an array and not an object

##### By workflow key

To perform a `create-instance` operation, invoke the Zeebe command binding with a `POST` method and the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "workflowKey": 2251799813685895,
    "variables": {
      "productId": "some-product-id",
      "productName": "some-product-name",
      "productKey": "some-product-key"
    }
  },
  "operation": "create-instance"
}
```

The data parameters are:

- `workflowKey` - the unique key identifying the workflow definition to instantiate
- `variables` - (optional) JSON document that will instantiate the variables for the root variable scope of the 
  workflow instance; it must be a JSON object, as variables will be mapped in a
  key-value fashion. e.g. { "a": 1, "b": 2 } will create two variables, named "a" and
  "b" respectively, with their associated values. [{ "a": 1, "b": 2 }] would not be a
  valid argument, as the root of the JSON document is an array and not an object


##### Response

The binding returns a JSON with the following response:

```json
{
  "workflowKey": 2251799813685895,
  "bpmnProcessId": "products-process",
  "version": 3,
  "workflowInstanceKey": 2251799813687851
}
```

The response values are:

- `bpmnProcessId` - the BPMN process ID of the workflow definition which was used to create the workflow instance
- `version` - the version of the workflow definition which was used to create the workflow instance
- `workflowInstanceKey` - the unique identifier of the created workflow instance

#### cancel-instance

The `cancel-instance` operation cancels a running workflow instance.

To perform a `cancel-instance` operation, invoke the Zeebe command binding with a `POST` method and the following JSON body:

  "data": {
    "workflowInstanceKey": 2251799813687851
  },
  "metadata": {},
  "operation": "cancel-instance"
}
```

The data parameters are:

- `workflowInstanceKey` - the workflow instance key

##### Response

The binding does not return a response body.

#### set-variables

The `set-variables` operation creates or updates variables for an element instance (e.g. workflow instance, flow element instance).

To perform a `set-variables` operation, invoke the Zeebe command binding with a `POST` method and the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "elementInstanceKey": 2251799813687880,
    "variables": {
      "productId": "some-product-id",
      "productName": "some-product-name",
      "productKey": "some-product-key"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {},
  "operation": "set-variables"
}
```

The data parameters are:

- `elementInstanceKey` - the unique identifier of a particular element; can be the workflow instance key (as 
  obtained during instance creation), or a given element, such as a service task (see elementInstanceKey on the job message)
- `local` - (optional, default: `false`) if true, the variables will be merged strictly into the local scope (as indicated by
  elementInstanceKey); this means the variables is not propagated to upper scopes.
  for example, let's say we have two scopes, '1' and '2', with each having effective variables as:
  1 => `{ "foo" : 2 }`, and 2 => `{ "bar" : 1 }`. if we send an update request with
  elementInstanceKey = 2, variables `{ "foo" : 5 }`, and local is true, then scope 1 will
  be unchanged, and scope 2 will now be `{ "bar" : 1, "foo" 5 }`. if local was false, however,
  then scope 1 would be `{ "foo": 5 }`, and scope 2 would be `{ "bar" : 1 }`
- `variables` - a JSON serialized document describing variables as key value pairs; the root of the document must be an object

##### Response

The binding returns a JSON with the following response:

```json
{
  "key": 2251799813687896
}
```

The response values are:

- `key` - the unique key of the set variables command

}
```

The data parameters are:

- `incidentKey` - the unique ID of the incident to resolve

{
  "messageName": "",
  "correlationKey": "2",
  "timeToLive": "1m",
  "variables": {
    "productId": "some-product-id",

- `variables` - (optional) a JSON document representing the variables in the current task scope

##### Response

The binding does not return a response body.

#### fail-job

The `fail-job` operation marks the job as failed; if the retries argument is positive, then the job will be immediately activatable again, and a 
worker could try again to process it. If it is zero or negative however, an incident will be raised, tagged with the given errorMessage, and the 
job will not be activatable until the incident is resolved.

To perform a `fail-job` operation, invoke the Zeebe command binding with a `POST` method and the following JSON body:

```json

```

The data parameters are:

- `jobKey` - the unique job identifier, as obtained when activating the job
- `retries` - the amount of retries the job should have left
- `errorMessage ` - (optional) an message describing why the job failed this is particularly useful if a job runs out of retries and an 
  incident is raised, as it this message can help explain why an incident was raised

##### Response

The binding does not return a response body.

#### update-job-retries

The `update-job-retries` operation updates the number of retries a job has left. This is mostly useful for jobs that have run out of retries, should the 
underlying problem be solved.

To perform a `update-job-retries` operation, invoke the Zeebe command binding with a `POST` method and the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "jobKey": 2251799813686172,

##### Response

The binding does not return a response body.

#### throw-error

The `throw-error` operation throw an error to indicate that a business error is occurred while processing the job. The error is identified 
by an error code and is handled by an error catch event in the workflow with the same error code.

To perform a `throw-error` operation, invoke the Zeebe command binding with a `POST` method and the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "jobKey": 2251799813686172,
