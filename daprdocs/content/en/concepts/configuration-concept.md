Dapr configurations are settings that enable you to change the behavior of individual Dapr application sidecars or globally on the system services in the Dapr control plane.
An example of a per Dapr application sidecar setting is configuring trace settings. An example of a Dapr control plane setting is mutual TLS which is a global setting on the Sentry system service.

Read [this page]({{<ref "configuration-overview.md">}}) for a list of all configuration options.
