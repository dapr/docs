The Dapr Placement service is used to calculate and distribute distributed hash tables for the location of [Dapr actors]({{< ref actors >}}) running in [self-hosted mode]({{< ref self-hosted >}}) or on [Kubernetes]({{< ref kubernetes >}}). Grouped by namespace, the hash tables map actor types to pods or processes so a Dapr application can communicate with the actor. Anytime a Dapr application activates a Dapr actor, the Placement service updates the hash tables with the latest actor location.

## Self-hosted mode

The Placement service Docker container is started automatically as part of [`dapr init`]({{< ref self-hosted-with-docker.md >}}). It can also be run manually as a process if you are running in [slim-init mode]({{< ref self-hosted-no-docker.md >}}).

## Kubernetes mode

The Placement service is deployed as part of `dapr init -k`, or via the Dapr Helm charts. For more information on running Dapr on Kubernetes, visit the [Kubernetes hosting page]({{< ref kubernetes >}}).

## Placement tables

There is an [HTTP API `/placement/state` for Placement service]({{< ref placement_api.md >}}) that exposes placement table information. The API is exposed on the sidecar on the same port as the healthz. This is an unauthenticated endpoint, and is disabled by default. You need to set `DAPR_PLACEMENT_METADATA_ENABLED` environment or `metadata-enabled` command line args to true to enable it. If you are using helm you just need to set `dapr_placement.metadataEnabled` to true.

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
When deploying actors into different namespaces ({{< ref namespaced-actors.md >}}), it is recommended to disable the `metadata-enabled` if you want to prevent retrieving actors from all namespaces. The metadata endpoint is scoped to all namespaces.
{{% /alert %}}

### Usecase:
The placement table API can be used to retrieve the current placement table, which contains all the actors registered across all namespaces. This is helpful for debugging and allowing tools to extract and present information about actors.

### HTTP Request

```
GET http://localhost:<healthzPort>/placement/state
```

### HTTP Response Codes

Code | Description
---- | -----------
200  | Placement tables information returned
500  | Placement could not return the placement tables information
