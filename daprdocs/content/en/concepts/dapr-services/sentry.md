The Dapr Sentry service manages mTLS between services and acts as a certificate authority. It generates mTLS certificates and distributes them to any running sidecars. This allows sidecars to communicate with encrypted, mTLS traffic. For more information read the [sidecar-to-sidecar communication overview]({{< ref "security-concept.md#sidecar-to-sidecar-communication" >}}). 

## Self-hosted mode

The sentry service Docker container is started automatically as part of [`dapr init`]({{< ref self-hosted-with-docker.md >}}). It can also be run manually as a process if you are running in [slim-init mode]({{< ref self-hosted-no-docker.md >}}).

## Kubernetes mode

The sentry service is deployed as part of `dapr init -k`, or via the Dapr Helm charts. For more information on running Dapr on Kubernetes, visit the [Kubernetes hosting page]({{< ref kubernetes >}}).
