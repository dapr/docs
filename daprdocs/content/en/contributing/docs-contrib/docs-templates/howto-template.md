## Contributing a new how-to guide

How-to guides provide step-by-step practical guidance to readers who wish to:

- Enable a feature
- Integrate a technology
- Use Dapr in a specific scenario

How-to guides can be considered "next-level", self-guided docs compared to quickstarts. How-to scenarios will take longer and can be more easily applied to the reader's individual project or environment.

When naming your how-to document, include the sub-directory name in the file name. If you need to create a new sub-directory, make sure it's descriptive and includes the relevant component or concept name. For example, _pubsub-namespaces_.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
This template is only a suggestion. Feel free to change based on your document's purpose.
{{% /alert %}}
