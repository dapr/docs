Dapr encourages the community to help with prioritization. A GitHub project board is available to view and provide feedback on proposed issues and track them across development.

Please vote by adding a üëç on the GitHub issues for the feature capabilities you would most like to see Dapr support. This will help the Dapr maintainers understand which features will provide the most value.

Contributions from the community is also welcomed. If there are features on the roadmap that you are interested in contributing to, please comment on the GitHub issue and include your solution proposal.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
