{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
 Resiliency is currently a preview feature.
{{% /alert %}}

Observe Dapr resiliency capabilities by simulating a system failure. In this Quickstart, you will:

- Run two microservice applications: `checkout` and `order-processor`. `checkout` will continuously make Dapr service invocation requests to `order-processor`. 
- Trigger the resiliency spec by simulating a system failure. 
- Remove the failure to allow the microservice application to recover.

### Pre-requisites

For this example, you will need:

- [Dapr CLI and initialized environment](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started).
- [Python 3.7+ installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
<!-- IGNORE_LINKS -->
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
<!-- END_IGNORE -->

### Step 1: Set up the environment

Clone the [sample provided in the Quickstarts repo](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/master/service_invocation).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts.git
```

### Step 2: Run `order-processor` service

In a terminal window, from the root of the Quickstart directory, navigate to `order-processor` directory.

```bash
cd ../service_invocation/python/http/order-processor
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the `order-processor` service alongside a Dapr sidecar.

```bash
dapr run --app-port 8001 --app-id order-processor  --config ../config.yaml --components-path ../../../components/ --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- python3 app.py
```

### Step 3: Run the `checkout` service application with resiliency enabled

In a new terminal window, from the root of the Quickstart directory, navigate to the `checkout` directory.

```bash
cd ../service_invocation/python/http/checkout
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the `checkout` service alongside a Dapr sidecar. The `--config` parameter applies a Dapr configuration that enables the resiliency feature.

```bash
dapr run  --app-id checkout --config ../config.yaml --components-path ../../../components/ --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3500 -- python3 app.py
```

By enabling resiliency, the resiliency spec located in the components directory is detected and loaded by the Dapr sidecar:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Resiliency
   metadata:
     name: myresiliency
   scopes:
     - checkout
   
   spec:
     policies:
       retries:
         retryForever:
           policy: constant
           maxInterval: 5s
           maxRetries: -1 
   
       circuitBreakers:
         simpleCB:
           maxRequests: 1
           timeout: 5s 
           trip: consecutiveFailures >= 5
   
     targets:
       apps:
         order-processor:
           retry: retryForever
           circuitBreaker: simpleCB
   ```

### Step 4: View the Service Invocation outputs
When both services and sidecars are running, notice how orders are passed from the `checkout` service to the `order-processor` service using Dapr service invoke. 

`checkout` service output:

```
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 1}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 2}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 3}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 4}
```

`order-processor` service output:

```
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 1}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 2}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 3}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 4}
```

### Step 5: Introduce a fault
Simulate a fault by stopping the `order-processor` service. Once the instance is stopped, service invoke operations from the `checkout` service begin to fail.

Since the `resiliency.yaml` spec defines the `order-processor` service as a resiliency target, all failed requests will apply retry and circuit breaker policies:

```yaml
  targets:
    apps:
      order-processor:
        retry: retryForever
        circuitBreaker: simpleCB
```

In the `order-processor` window, stop the service:

{{< tabs "MacOs" "Windows" >}}

 <!-- MacOS -->

{{% codetab %}}

```script
CMD + C
```

{{% /codetab %}}

 <!-- Windows -->

{{% codetab %}}

```script
CTRL + C
```

{{% /codetab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}


Once the first request fails, the retry policy titled `retryForever` is applied:

```bash
INFO[0005] Error processing operation endpoint[order-processor, order-processor:orders]. Retrying...  
```

Retries will continue for each failed request indefinitely, in 5 second intervals. 

```yaml
retryForever:
  policy: constant
  maxInterval: 5s
  maxRetries: -1 
```

Once 5 consecutive retries have failed, the circuit breaker policy, `simpleCB`, is tripped and the breaker opens, halting all requests:

```bash
INFO[0025] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from closed to open  
```

```yaml
circuitBreakers:
  simpleCB:
  maxRequests: 1
  timeout: 5s 
  trip: consecutiveFailures >= 5
```

After 5 seconds has surpassed, the circuit breaker will switch to a half-open state, allowing one request through to verify if the fault has been resolved. If the request continues to fail, the circuit will trip back to the open state. 

```bash
INFO[0030] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from open to half-open  
INFO[0030] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from half-open to open   
INFO[0030] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from open to half-open  
INFO[0030] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from half-open to open     
```

This half-open/open behavior will continue for as long as the `order-processor` service is stopped. 

### Step 6: Remove the fault

Once you restart the `order-processor` service, the application will recover seamlessly, picking up where it left off with accepting order requests.

In the `order-processor` service terminal, restart the application:

```bash
dapr run --app-port 8001 --app-id order-processor --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- python3 app.py
```

`checkout` service output:

```
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 5}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 6}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 7}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 8}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 9}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 10}
```

`order-processor` service output:

```
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 5}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 6}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 7}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 8}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 9}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 10}
```

dapr run --app-id order-processor --config ../config.yaml --components-path ../../../components/ --app-port 9001 --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- java -jar target/OrderProcessingService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

`checkout` service output:

```

== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 6}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 7}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 8}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 9}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 10}
```

`order-processor` service output:

### Pre-requisites

For this example, you will need:

- [Dapr CLI and initialized environment](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started).
- [Latest version of Go](https://go.dev/dl/).
<!-- IGNORE_LINKS -->
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
<!-- END_IGNORE -->

### Step 1: Set up the environment

Clone the [sample provided in the Quickstarts repo](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/master/service_invocation).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts.git
```

### Step 2: Run the `order-processor` service

In a terminal window, from the root of the Quickstart directory,
navigate to `order-processor` directory.

```bash
cd ../service_invocation/go/http/order-processor
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
go build .
```

Run the `order-processor` service alongside a Dapr sidecar.

```bash
dapr run --app-port 6001 --app-id order-processor --config ../config.yaml --components-path ../../../components/ --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- go run .
```

### Step 3: Run the `checkout` service application with resiliency enabled

In a new terminal window, from the root of the Quickstart directory,
navigate to the `checkout` directory.

```bash
cd ../service_invocation/go/http/checkout
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
go build .
```

Run the `checkout` service alongside a Dapr sidecar. The `--config` parameter applies a Dapr configuration that enables the resiliency feature.

```bash
dapr run  --app-id checkout --config ../config.yaml --components-path ../../../components/  --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3500 -- go run .
```

By enabling resiliency, the resiliency spec located in the components directory is detected and loaded by the Dapr sidecar:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Resiliency
   metadata:
     name: myresiliency
   scopes:
     - checkout
   
   spec:
     policies:
       retries:
         retryForever:
           policy: constant
           maxInterval: 5s
           maxRetries: -1 
   
       circuitBreakers:
         simpleCB:
           maxRequests: 1
           timeout: 5s 
           trip: consecutiveFailures >= 5
   
     targets:
       apps:
         order-processor:
           retry: retryForever
           circuitBreaker: simpleCB
   ```

### Step 4: View the Service Invocation outputs
When both services and sidecars are running, notice how orders are passed from the `checkout` service to the `order-processor` service using Dapr service invoke. 

`checkout` service output:

```
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 1}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 2}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 3}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 4}
```

`order-processor` service output:

```
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 1}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 2}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 3}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 4}
```

### Step 5: Introduce a fault
Simulate a fault by stopping the `order-processor` service. Once the instance is stopped, service invoke operations from the `checkout` service begin to fail.

Since the `resiliency.yaml` spec defines the `order-processor` service as a resiliency target, all failed requests will apply retry and circuit breaker policies:

```yaml
  targets:
    apps:
      order-processor:
        retry: retryForever
        circuitBreaker: simpleCB
```

In the `order-processor` window, stop the service:

{{< tabs "MacOs" "Windows" >}}

 <!-- MacOS -->

{{% codetab %}}

```script
CMD + C
```

{{% /codetab %}}

 <!-- Windows -->

{{% codetab %}}

```script
CTRL + C
```

{{% /codetab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}


Once the first request fails, the retry policy titled `retryForever` is applied:

```bash
INFO[0005] Error processing operation endpoint[order-processor, order-processor:orders]. Retrying...  
```

Retries will continue for each failed request indefinitely, in 5 second intervals. 

```yaml
retryForever:
  policy: constant
  maxInterval: 5s
  maxRetries: -1 
```

Once 5 consecutive retries have failed, the circuit breaker policy, `simpleCB`, is tripped and the breaker opens, halting all requests:

```bash
INFO[0025] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from closed to open  
```

```yaml
circuitBreakers:
  simpleCB:
  maxRequests: 1
  timeout: 5s 
  trip: consecutiveFailures >= 5
```

After 5 seconds has surpassed, the circuit breaker will switch to a half-open state, allowing one request through to verify if the fault has been resolved. If the request continues to fail, the circuit will trip back to the open state. 

```bash
INFO[0030] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from open to half-open  
INFO[0030] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from half-open to open   
INFO[0030] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from open to half-open  
INFO[0030] Circuit breaker "order-processor:orders" changed state from half-open to open     
```

This half-open/open behavior will continue for as long as the Redis container is stopped. 

### Step 6: Remove the fault

Once you restart the `order-processor` service, the application will recover seamlessly, picking up where it left off. 

In the `order-processor` service terminal, restart the application:

```bash
dapr run --app-port 6001 --app-id order-processor --config ../config.yaml --components-path ../../../components/ --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- go run .
```

`checkout` service output:

```
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 5}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 6}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 7}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 8}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 9}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 10}
```

`order-processor` service output:

```
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 5}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 6}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 7}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 8}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 9}
== APP == Order received: {"orderId": 10}
```
