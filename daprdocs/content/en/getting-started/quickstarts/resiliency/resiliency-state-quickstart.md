---

Observe Dapr resiliency capabilities by simulating a system failure. In this Quickstart, you will:

- Execute a microservice application that continuously persists and retrieves state via Dapr's state management API. 
- Trigger resiliency policies by simulating a system failure. 
- Resolve the failure and the microservice application will resume.

### Pre-requisites

For this example, you will need:

- [Dapr CLI and initialized environment](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started).
- [Python 3.7+ installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
<!-- IGNORE_LINKS -->
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
<!-- END_IGNORE -->

### Step 1: Set up the environment

Clone the [sample provided in the Quickstarts repo](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/master/resiliency).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts.git
```

In a terminal window, navigate to the `order-processor` directory.

```bash
cd ../state_management/python/sdk/order-processor
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Step 2: Run the application

Run the `order-processor` service alongside a Dapr sidecar. The Dapr sidecar then loads the resiliency spec located in the resources directory:


   ```yaml
   apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Resiliency
   metadata:
     name: myresiliency
   scopes:
     - checkout
   
   spec:
     policies:
       retries:
         retryForever:
           policy: constant
           maxInterval: 5s
           maxRetries: -1 
   
       circuitBreakers:
         simpleCB:
           maxRequests: 1
           timeout: 5s 
           trip: consecutiveFailures >= 5
   
     targets:
       apps:
         order-processor:
           retry: retryForever
           circuitBreaker: simpleCB
   ```


```bash
dapr run --app-id order-processor --resources-path ../../../resources/ -- python3
```

Once the application has started, the `order-processor`service writes and reads `orderId` key/value pairs to the `statestore` Redis instance [defined in the `statestore.yaml` component]({{< ref "statemanagement-quickstart.md#statestoreyaml-component-file" >}}).

```bash
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '1' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '1' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '2' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '2' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '3' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '3' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '4' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '4' }
```

### Step 3: Introduce a fault

Simulate a fault by stopping the Redis container instance that was initialized when executing `dapr init` on your development machine. Once the instance is stopped, write and read operations from the `order-processor` service begin to fail.

Since the `resiliency.yaml` spec defines `statestore` as a component target, all failed requests will apply retry and circuit breaker policies:

```yaml
  targets:
    components:
      statestore:
        outbound:
          retry: retryForever
          circuitBreaker: simpleCB
```

In a new terminal window, run the following command to stop Redis:

```bash
docker stop dapr_redis
```

Once Redis is stopped, the requests begin to fail and the retry policy titled `retryForever` is applied. The output below shows the logs from the `order-processor` service:

```bash
INFO[0006] Error processing operation component[statestore] output. Retrying...
```

As per the `retryForever` policy, retries will continue for each failed request indefinitely, in 5 second intervals. 

```yaml
retryForever:
  policy: constant
  maxInterval: 5s
  maxRetries: -1 
```

Once 5 consecutive retries have failed, the circuit breaker policy, `simpleCB`, is tripped and the breaker opens, halting all requests:

```bash
INFO[0026] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from closed to open
```

```yaml
circuitBreakers:
  simpleCB:
  maxRequests: 1
  timeout: 5s 
  trip: consecutiveFailures >= 5
```

After 5 seconds has surpassed, the circuit breaker will switch to a half-open state, allowing one request through to verify if the fault has been resolved. If the request continues to fail, the circuit will trip back to the open state. 

```bash
INFO[0031] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from open to half-open  
INFO[0031] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from half-open to open 
INFO[0036] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from open to half-open  
INFO[0036] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from half-open to closed  
```

This half-open/open behavior will continue for as long as the Redis container is stopped. 

### Step 3: Remove the fault

Once you restart the Redis container on your machine, the application will recover seamlessly, picking up where it left off.

```bash
docker start dapr_redis
```

```bash
INFO[0036] Recovered processing operation component[statestore] output.  
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '5' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '5' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '6' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '6' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '7' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '7' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '8' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '8' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '9' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '9' }
```

```

In a terminal window, navigate to the `order-processor` directory.

```bash
cd ../state_management/go/sdk/order-processor
```

Install dependencies

```bash
go build .
```

### Step 2: Run the application

Run the `order-processor` service alongside a Dapr sidecar. The Dapr sidecar then loads the resiliency spec located in the resources directory:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Resiliency
   metadata:
     name: myresiliency
   scopes:
     - checkout
   
   spec:
     policies:
       retries:
         retryForever:
           policy: constant
           maxInterval: 5s
           maxRetries: -1 
   
       circuitBreakers:
         simpleCB:
           maxRequests: 1

     targets:
       apps:
         order-processor:
           retry: retryForever
           circuitBreaker: simpleCB
   ```

```bash
dapr run --app-id order-processor --resources-path ../../../resources -- go run .
```

Once the application has started, the `order-processor`service writes and reads `orderId` key/value pairs to the `statestore` Redis instance [defined in the `statestore.yaml` component]({{< ref "statemanagement-quickstart.md#statestoreyaml-component-file" >}}).

```bash
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '1' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '1' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '2' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '2' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '3' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '3' }
== APP == Saving Order:  { orderId: '4' }
== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '4' }
```

### Step 3: Introduce a fault

Simulate a fault by stopping the Redis container instance that was initialized when executing `dapr init` on your development machine. Once the instance is stopped, write and read operations from the `order-processor` service begin to fail.

Since the `resiliency.yaml` spec defines `statestore` as a component target, all failed requests will apply retry and circuit breaker policies:

```yaml
  targets:
    components:
      statestore:
        outbound:
          retry: retryForever
          circuitBreaker: simpleCB
```

In a new terminal window, run the following command to stop Redis:

```bash
docker stop dapr_redis
```

Once Redis is stopped, the requests begin to fail and the retry policy titled `retryForever` is applied. The output belows shows the logs from the `order-processor` service:

```bash
INFO[0006] Error processing operation component[statestore] output. Retrying...
```

As per the `retryForever` policy, retries will continue for each failed request indefinitely, in 5 second intervals. 

```yaml
retryForever:
  policy: constant
  maxInterval: 5s
  maxRetries: -1 
```

Once 5 consecutive retries have failed, the circuit breaker policy, `simpleCB`, is tripped and the breaker opens, halting all requests:

```bash
INFO[0026] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from closed to open
```

```yaml
circuitBreakers:
  simpleCB:
  maxRequests: 1
  timeout: 5s 
  trip: consecutiveFailures >= 5
```

After 5 seconds has surpassed, the circuit breaker will switch to a half-open state, allowing one request through to verify if the fault has been resolved. If the request continues to fail, the circuit will trip back to the open state. 

```bash
INFO[0031] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from open to half-open  
INFO[0031] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from half-open to open 
INFO[0036] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from open to half-open  
INFO[0036] Circuit breaker "simpleCB-statestore" changed state from half-open to closed  
```

This half-open/open behavior will continue for as long as the Redis container is stopped. 

### Step 3: Remove the fault

Once you restart the Redis container on your machine, the application will recover seamlessly, picking up where it left off.

```bash
docker start dapr_redis
```

```bash
INFO[0036] Recovered processing operation component[statestore] output.

== APP == Getting Order:  { orderId: '8' }

```
