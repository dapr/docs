{{% alert title="Alpha" color="warning" %}}
The scheduler building block is currently in **alpha**. 
{{% /alert %}}

Let's take a look at the Dapr scheduler building block. In this Quickstart, you'll create an application that demonstrates how the scheduler API orchestrates tasks and jobs within a distributed environment. You'll:
- Need bullet point of what user will do in quickstart
- Need bullet point #2?

Need diagram

Currently, you can experiment with the scheduler API using .NET HTTP, Go SDK, and Go HTTP.
