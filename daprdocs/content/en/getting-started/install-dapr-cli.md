description: "Install the Dapr CLI as the main tool for running Dapr-related tasks"
---

You'll use the Dapr CLI as the main tool for various Dapr-related tasks. You can use it to:

- Run an application with a Dapr sidecar.
- Review sidecar logs.
- List running services.
- Run the Dapr dashboard.

The Dapr CLI works with both [self-hosted]({{< ref self-hosted >}}) and [Kubernetes]({{< ref Kubernetes >}}) environments.

### Step 1: Install the Dapr CLI

{{< tabs Linux Windows MacOS Binaries>}}

{{% codetab %}}

#### Install from Terminal

Install the latest Linux Dapr CLI to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.sh -O - | /bin/bash
```

#### Install without `sudo`

If you do not have access to the `sudo` command or your username is not in the `sudoers` file, you can install Dapr to an alternate directory via the `DAPR_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable. This directory must already exist and be accessible by the current user.

```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.sh -O - | DAPR_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/dapr" /bin/bash
```

#### Install from Command Prompt

Install the latest windows Dapr cli to `$Env:SystemDrive\dapr` and add this directory to the User PATH environment variable:

```powershell
powershell -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Note:** Updates to PATH might not be visible until you restart your terminal application.

#### Install without administrative rights

If you do not have admin rights, you can install Dapr to an alternate directory via the `DAPR_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable. The script below creates the directory if it does not exist.

```powershell
$Env:DAPR_INSTALL_DIR = "<your_alt_install_dir_path>"
$script=iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.ps1; $block=[ScriptBlock]::Create($script); invoke-command -ScriptBlock $block -ArgumentList "", "$Env:DAPR_INSTALL_DIR"
```

#### Install using winget

Install the latest Windows Dapr CLI to `$Env:SystemDrive\dapr` and add this directory to the user PATH environment variable:

```powershell
winget install Dapr.CLI
```

**For preview releases:**

Install the latest preview release:

```powershell
winget install Dapr.CLI.Preview
```

#### Install using MSI installer

Each release of the Dapr CLI also includes an installer for Windows. You can manually download the MSI:

1. Download the MSI package `dapr.msi` from latest [Dapr release](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases).
2. Navigate to the downloaded MSI file and double-click the file to run it.
3. Follow the installation prompts to accept the license and the installation directory. The selected folder is added to the user PATH environment variable. The default value is set to `$Env:SystemDrive\dapr`.
4. Click `Install` to start the installation. You will see a final message once the installation is complete.

### Install from Terminal

Install the latest Darwin Dapr CLI to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

**For ARM64 Macs:**

When installing from the terminal, native ARM64 binaries are available. 

To install Rosetta emulation:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

#### Install from Homebrew

Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install dapr/tap/dapr-cli
```

**For ARM64 Macs:**

For ARM64 Macs, Homebrew 3.0 and higher versions are supported. Update Homebrew to 3.0.0 or higher and then run the command below:

```bash
arch -arm64 brew install dapr/tap/dapr-cli
```

#### Install without `sudo`
If you do not have access to the `sudo` command or your username is not in the `sudoers` file, you can install Dapr to an alternate directory via the `DAPR_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable. This directory must already exist and be accessible by the current user.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.sh | DAPR_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/dapr" /bin/bash
```

Each release of Dapr CLI includes various OSes and architectures. You can manually download and install these binary versions.

1. Download the desired Dapr CLI from the latest [Dapr Release](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases).
2. Unpack it (e.g. dapr_linux_amd64.tar.gz, dapr_windows_amd64.zip).
3. Move it to your desired location.
   - For Linux/MacOS, we recommend `/usr/local/bin`.
   - For Windows, create a directory and add this to your System PATH. For example:
     - Create a directory called `C:\dapr`.
     - Add your newly created directory to your User PATH, by editing your system environment variable.
