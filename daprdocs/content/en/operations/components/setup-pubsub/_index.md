Dapr integrates with pub/sub message buses to provide applications with the ability to create event-driven, loosely coupled architectures where producers send events to consumers via topics.

Dapr supports the configuration of multiple, named, pub/sub components *per application*. Each pub/sub component has a name and this name is used when publishing a message topic. Read the [API reference]({{< ref pubsub_api.md >}}) for details on how to publish and subscribe to topics.

Pub/sub components are extensible. A list of support pub/sub components is [here]({{< ref supported-pubsub >}}) and the implementations can be found in the [components-contrib repo](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib).

## Component files

A pub/sub is described using a `Component` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: pubsub
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: pubsub.<NAME>
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: <KEY>
    value: <VALUE>
  - name: <KEY>
    value: <VALUE>
...
```

The type of pub/sub is determined by the `type` field, and properties such as connection strings and other metadata are put in the `.metadata` section.
Even though metadata values can contain secrets in plain text, it is recommended you use a [secret store]({{< ref component-secrets.md >}}) using a `secretKeyRef`.

Depending on the pub/sub message bus you are using and how it is configured, topics may be created automatically. Even if the message bus supports automatic topic creation, it is a common governance practice to disable it in production environments. You may still need to use a CLI, admin console, or request form to manually create the topics required by your application.
