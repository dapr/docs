---

Typically, in distributed computing, you may only want to allow for a given number of requests to execute concurrently. Using Dapr's `app-max-concurrency`, you can control how many requests and events can invoke your application simultaneously.

## Different approaches

While this guide focuses on `app-max-concurrency`, you can also limit request rate per second using the **`middleware.http.ratelimit`** middleware. However, it's important to understand the difference between the two approaches:

- `middleware.http.ratelimit`: Time bound and limits the number of requests per second
- `app-max-concurrency`: Specifies the number of concurrent requests (and events) at any point of time. 

See [Rate limit middleware]({{< ref middleware-rate-limit.md >}}) for more information about that approach.

## Configure `app-max-concurrency`

Without using Dapr, you would need to create some sort of a semaphore in the application and take care of acquiring and releasing it.

Using Dapr, you don't need to make any code changes to your application.

Select how you'd like to configure `app-max-concurrency`.

 <!-- CLI -->
{{% codetab %}}

To set concurrency limits with the Dapr CLI for running on your local dev machine, add the `app-max-concurrency` flag:

```bash
dapr run --app-max-concurrency 1 --app-port 5000 python ./app.py
```

The above example effectively turns your app into a single concurrent service.

 <!-- Kubernetes -->

To configure concurrency limits in Kubernetes, add the following annotation to your pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nodesubscriber
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: nodesubscriber
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nodesubscriber
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nodesubscriber
      annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/app-id: "nodesubscriber"
        dapr.io/app-port: "3000"
        dapr.io/app-max-concurrency: "1"
#...
```

{{% /codetab %}}

## Limitations

### Controlling concurrency on external requests
Rate limiting is guaranteed for every event coming _from_ Dapr, including pub/sub events, direct invocation from other services, bindings events, etc. However, Dapr can't enforce the concurrency policy on requests that are coming _to_ your app externally.
