## Overview
Some features in Dapr are considered experimental when they are first released. These features require explicit opt-in in order to be used. The opt-in is specified in Dapr's configuration.

Currently, preview features are enabled on a per application basis. A global scope may be introduced in the future should there be a use case for it.

### Current preview features
Below is a list of existing preview features:
- Actor Reentrancy

## Configuration properties
The `features` section under the `Configuration` spec contains the following properties:

| Property       | Type   | Description |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
|name|string|The name of the preview feature that will be enabled/disabled
|enabled|bool|Boolean specifying if the feature is enabled or disabled

## Enabling a preview feature
Preview features are specified in the configuration. Here is an example of a full configuration that contains multiple features:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: featureconfig
spec:
  tracing:
    samplingRate: "1"
    zipkin:
      endpointAddress: "http://zipkin.default.svc.cluster.local:9411/api/v2/spans"
  features:
    - name: Feature1
      enabled: true
    - name: Feature2
      enabled: true
```

### Standalone
To enabled a preview feature when running dapr locally, the configuration can be provided in two separate ways.

The primary way to provide the configuration is by specifying it while starting an application with the CLI.

```bash
dapr run --app-id myApp --config ./previewConfig.yaml ./app
```

Should every app require the preview feature the configuration that dapr generates during `dapr init` can be modified. Doing this removes the need to specify `--config` in the `run` command as the configuration generated by dapr is used by default. Note, modifying this configuration by hand can be dangerous as an error in it would affect all applications that are started after the modification.

### Kubernetes
In kubernetes, the configuration must be provided via a configuration component. Using the same configuration as above, apply it via `kubectl`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f previewConfig.yaml
```

This can then be referenced in any application by modifying the application's configuration to reference that specific configuration component via the `dapr.io/config` element. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nodeapp
  labels:
    app: node
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node
      annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/app-id: "nodeapp"
        dapr.io/app-port: "3000"
        dapr.io/config: "featureconfig"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node
        image: dapriosamples/hello-k8s-node:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        imagePullPolicy: Always
```
