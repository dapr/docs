Preview features in Dapr are considered experimental when they are first released. 

Runtime preview features require explicit opt-in in order to be used. The runtime opt-in is specified in a preview setting feature in Dapr's application configuration. See [How-To: Enable preview features]({{<ref preview-features>}}) for more information.

For CLI there is no explicit opt-in, just the version that this was first made available.
